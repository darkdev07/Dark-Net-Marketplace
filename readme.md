#  Just some reference for my work see about me from my aboutme repository

So you wanna create a marketplace, and you need to find a dev, dark php is here<br \>
tough its a pseudo name but it sounds cool <br \>

# How to proceed with the order 

First discuss with me what do you want, all the functions, what coins do you need,
what extra things you want, all the demands that you give i need to discuss that with my 
team of 3 people who have a solid experience in ui ux, pentesting , and my secondary dev 

Then we will quote a price like the avg mixers cost 3000 to 5000 $, the avg single vendor 
costs, much lower like 1000 to 3000$  and a multifunctional marketplace can cost 
a whopping 7000 to 14 k $ the more function you say the more pice it gets but this price can be 
little increased or decreased 

Then You have to pay 20 % the inital amount decided to us to start the rest you can escrow 
with reputable escrow like bb gate or escrofy or other things with a term to release the amount to us
after successfull delivery of the code 

Then Your work can start we share the ip of the production server to you to see the creation of your 
marketplace any changes you want you can tell us and we will do that

We will prompt you again after the initial back end done to get your ideas about the looks of the marketplace cause looks do matter , our ui ux dev will be all implementing your ideas carefully 

what you need to arrange for your marketplace is just a great looking logo 

Then after all the ui ux and backend and front end done, we will get a conformation for you about the features you ask , then we will bug hunt , configure ,and pentest the marketplace for almost two weeks to ensure a highly secure and bug free code 

And a 6 month bug fixing warranty comes with all our creation and then extra cost applies 

# What not to do 

I got a lot of offers on my previous account to copy other marketplace for phising and all 
if you ask that you will get blocked we provide custom scripts we will not copy any other dev creation cause it bad for a dev to do that

Don't contact us if you don't know what you are doing 

We only create scripts we don't use them or resell them cause we delete that from our side after sending you. 

You need to host that script on your vps after production but we will help you in hosting it so not ask us to host that for ya 

# Payment method 

We need a 20 % cost upfront as a  token money to start your project and the remaining amount in escrow all payments will be done in btc or xmr .
